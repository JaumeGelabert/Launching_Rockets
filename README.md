# 🚀​ Launching Rockets 🚀​

Dummy project to learn in detail how to integrate a client with React and a server with Express. Using Jest for testing, GraphQL and other technologies.

I have followed the Zero to Mastery project guide (see acknowledgments section) and have been applying, in parallel, the knowledge learned to personal projects (without following any guide) to consolidate.
## Tech Stack 👨‍💻​

**Client:** React

**Server:** Node, Express, GraphQL

**Database:** MongoDB


## Lessons Learned 💡​

I would highlight the importance of creating a good architecture from the beginning, as it allows you to move forward instead of fighting with the code.

Also mention that since it is a Full Stack project, you understand the relationships between the frontend and the backend very well. In this way, if I worked only on the frontend, I would take the backend into account many times to optimize the code from the beginning.
